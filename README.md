# Early-vocab-training

This is a project designed to enhance the vocab, speech, and spelling of English speakers.

## Origin

My son required speech therapy for a year and I would like to build a tool that will continue to allow him to extend and improve his speaking ability and vocabulary.


## Setup
The app consists of a client and server, each with their own node_modules.

* Clone this repo
* run npm install
* cd into server
* run npm install

You must start the client from the root directory. you can use npm start or a custom angular cli command.

To start the server, cd into the server directory and run npm start.
